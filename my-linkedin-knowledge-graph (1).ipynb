There are also social networks between friends and family. All these systems consist of certain points called nodes, some of which are connected by edges. In mathematics, this is called fork\n\nA graph is a collection of vertices connected by edges.\n\nGraph theory is the study of graphs and their properties.

These are calledof directed graphs\nIn a directed graph, every edge has an “arrow”, that is, a start vertex and an end vertex.\n\n\nSome graphs consist of several distinct segments that are not connected by edges. These graphs are disconnected .\n\nOther graphs may contain multiple edges between the same pairs of vertices, or vertices connected to themselves (loops).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Graph Theory\n\nGraph Theory, a branch of mathematics and also of computing, serves as the basis for Network Science, so it is important to understand a little of this theory to know the main terms used in this area, such as: nodes, links, paths, distance etc.\n\nIf you are currently studying or have studied a bachelor's degree in the area of ​​informatics/computing, you have certainly already had a formal introduction to the subject and these concepts below will be familiar to you. If you've never heard of it, I hope this introduction helps you. To understand it, you only need to know discrete mathematical structures like sets and tuples.\n\nDo you think that talking about networks using mathematics is unnecessary rigor? If so, consider mathematics as a language, similar to Portuguese or English, but with a special property: it is free from ambiguity. In other words, the language of mathematics allows us to communicate ideas clearly (and concisely), as long as you know its vocabulary.\n\nIn the context of Network Science, a network will be like a graph, with nodes and edges interconnecting them, but with the difference that the network is dynamic, that is, the network changes over time, adding and removing nodes. and edges. In this way, graphs become like an instantaneous view of a network at a given instant in time.\n\nThe graph formalism is used in the modeling of complex networks in different contexts such as social sciences, physics, mathematics, etc. What makes them so versatile is the generality for representation between objects and their relationships. Therefore, graph theory gives us the necessary tools for modeling complex networks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Graphs\nA graph is more than a picture with an x- and y-axis in computer science circles for those unfamiliar with graphs. A graph is a mathematical construct used to represent networks, which are collections of objects that are linked in some way. Graph analysis is, at its core, a study of relationships.\n\nThis is significant because the value in data comes from discovering and comprehending the relationship between the various data points. In our industry, Facebook is the most frequently cited example when explaining the value of graphs, and while we intuitively understand this value (I can see who my kids are hanging out with), let's break this value down in more detail.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of graphs is that they can be displayed visually.\n\nA graph can be represented simply as a collection of dots with lines connecting them. Dots can represent anything from people to pets, and lines between the dots indicate how they are related.\n\nGraphs are structures that represent a set of items and the relationship between them. A graph G(V, E) is composed of vertices (also known as nodes) that connect via edges (also known as links or pairs of nodes).\n\nGraph analysis is not a new branch of data science, yet it is not the usual method of \"applying\" what data scientists apply today.\n\nHowever, there are some crazy things that graphics can do. Classic use cases range from fraud detection to recommendations or social media analytics. A non-classical use case in NLP deals with extracting topics (word graphs).\n\n\nExample of a graph composed of six vertices. Each sphere represents a vertex, and the lines connecting them are the edges that indicate a relationship between them.

This enables organizations to rapidly analyze large amounts of transactional data to detect patterns in real-time.\n\nOrganizations, for example, can analyze patterns in customer, social, and product data in real-time to detect fraudulent social media accounts that can invalidate marketing intelligence.\n\nQueries that track this type of fraud can run in seconds and provide users with a visual representation of the results that shows the data relationships.\n\nGraphs are convenient to represent relationships between objects. Therefore, we can gain valuable insights by visually displaying these graphs and crunching the data in real-time.\n\nGraph theory is becoming popular in business to simplify and interpret complex data. As our data volumes increase, graphs enable the visualization of that data and its patterns, allowing businesses to make more informed decisions.\n\nGraph theory underpins graph analysis. Graphs, also known as network graphs because they depict a network of interconnections, are mathematical structures used to model relationships between objects. They provide an effective means of visualizing data and its relationships. Graphs also provide an optimized data structure for computers to perform calculations using the best algorithms for the specific problem at hand.\n\nWhile graphs have grown in popularity for depicting and analyzing social networks, their business value extends far beyond that.\n\nToday, most business data is stored and analyzed in tables of rows and columns; an example is a spreadsheet.\n\nTypically, each row represents a single thing (for example, a person), and each column represents data about that thing (name, birthdate, eye color, etc.)\n\nEach row represents the same thing (people in this example).\nThis is structured (in this case, a table) and homogeneous data (every row is a person).\n\nGraphs enable us to represent and explore the relationships between various types of things (people, places, businesses, roads, traffic, and weather) in ways that would be difficult or time-consuming with structured data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Two examples of application of Network Graphs in Business\n\n#### Consider a fraud detection use case\nYou have a customer database and would like to know how they are connected to each other. Especially, you know that some customers are involved in complex fraud structures, but viewing the data at an individual level does not provide evidence of fraud. Fraudsters look like other regular customers.\n\nWorking on connections between users can show you much more information than if you simply visualize raw data. Specifically, features that would not be considered risky for a usual machine learning-based scoring model (phone number, email address, home address) can become risky features in a graph-based scoring model.\n\nConsidering three individuals with the same phone numbers, connected to others with the same email addresses, is unusual and potentially risky. The phone number value does not provide any information per se (so even the best deep learning model does not capture any value), but the fact that individuals are connected through the same phone number or email address values can be synonymous with risk. \n\nIt could be very well visualized in a network graph!\n\nAlso, as another example, let’s look at ridesharing or food delivery services.\n\nFood service delivery needs to assign the optimum driver to the pickup and delivery of orders. Let’s look at one simple decision that you need to make: which driver is the best option to pick up and deliver the food, based on minimizing time to delivery and cost of delivery? With those requirements (or constraints) you don’t want to task a driver who is 15 minutes away to pick up an order when there’s an available driver already within 2 miles.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from pyvis import network as net","metadata":{"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-11T23:55:50.609363Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-11T23:55:50.609640Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-11T23:55:50.615034Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-11T23:55:50.609610Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-11T23:55:50.613765Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1112,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example of simple network explaining how complex is the multicultural communication in my family","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Raw data formats can be difficult for human brains to process.

This means that your analysis tools will be accessible to the broadest possible audience.\n\nThe graph below depicts how difficult it can be for my family to communicate correctly at times.

How do we connect with friends using just Facebook? Therefore, Facebook and other social networking sites work on a methodology called social networking. Social network is mostly used on all social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn etc. It has a significant effect on marketers to engage customers. \n\nSocial networks use graphics to create a network. Its nodes are people and the edges are their connections to each other. Two nodes with connected edges are friends. Now let's see an example to understand what social networks are. \n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them. \n\nExamples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, memes spread,information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, social networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. \n\nThese networks are often visualized through sociograms in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.\n\nSocial network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology. It has also gained significant popularity in the following - anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies,economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, political science, public health, social psychology, development studies, sociolinguistics, and computer science and is now commonly available as a consumer tool (see the list of SNA software).\n\nThe advantages of SNA are twofold. Firstly, it can process a large amount of relational data and describe the overall relational network structure. tem and parameter selection to confirm the influential nodes in the network, such as in-degree and out-degree centrality. SNA context and choose which parameters to define the “center” according to the characteristics of the network. Through analyzing nodes, clusters and relations, the communication structure and position of individuals can be clearly described.\n\nNetworks (a.k.a graphs) are one of the most interesting areas of data science and have been subject to an explosion of interest in recent years. The ability to model the relationship between data points is powerful. This article introduces some basic concepts in network science and gives in python using networkx, the go-to python package for network related analysis.

Networks also have significant applications in the modelling of pandemics and in modelling biological systems. The ability to model the relationships between agents has applications far and wide.\n\nThe uses of this type of analysis stretch far and wide, and are rapidly increasing in popularity. \n\nThere are many different forms that network analysis can take, this article just scratches the surface. \n\nA whole host of different algorithms are implemented in networkx.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Accessing the Data - My LinkedIn Connections\n\nMy LinkedIn network at the moment when I wrote this article contains more than 26470 people. \n\nThe most important python library used in social networks is Networkx.\n\nNetworkX\nNetworkX is a graphics package used to create and modify different types of graphics.
